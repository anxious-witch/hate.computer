# hate.computer

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Add the mongodb URI to your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
vim .env.local
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) with your browser to see the result.

## API

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
